# PongRemastered! (November IDP)
**PongRemastered is an HTML/JS Pong clone. I wanted to try to make an HTML game in comparison to Python. I found it more complicated, but I'm able to make more sophisticated games than I could with Python.**

- `BallSpeed` starts at 20
- `BallSpeed` and `PlayerSpeed` increases every time the ball collides into either a player or the wall.
- You can play it ***locally*** with another friend :( .
- Control guide is at the bottom of the page, and they are attached here:

Player 1: W - move up; S - move down
