# November IDP - Pong Clone

In this project, I created a clone of the famous Atari game "Pong". This game was programmed in HTML and JavaScript. This project included a lot of new experiences for me that I did not have much regards for before. The HTML section of this project mainly focused on the basic site design and text. The JavaScript part mainly controled the gameplay aspects such as ball physics, collision, and scoring. This was not written using P5.JS so there wasn't a draw function. This also was the first time I used GitHub to put up the project, and took advantage of the full screen size. It is advised to run this program using [this link](https://PongRemastered.kingtastic.repl.co). 

To create such a game, all six things would have to be used to different extents. For example, seeing if the ball went off of the field or a paddle required a conditional, and the score would be kept in a variable.
